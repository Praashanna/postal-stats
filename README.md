# Postal Stats

A modern web application designed to work alongside [Postal MTA](https://github.com/postalserver/postal) to provide enhanced statistics and analytics that overcome some limitations of Postal's built-in stats dashboard.

## Overview

Postal is an excellent open-source mail delivery platform, but its statistics interface can be limited for users who need more detailed analytics and better visualization of their email delivery data. Postal Stats addresses these limitations by providing:

- Enhanced data visualization
- Better filtering and search capabilities
- Improved bounce analysis
- More detailed delivery statistics
- Modern, responsive UI built with React and TypeScript

## Features

- üìä **Advanced Analytics**: Comprehensive email delivery statistics with interactive charts
- üîç **Enhanced Filtering**: Filter data by date ranges, domains, and delivery status
- üìà **Bounce Analysis**: Detailed bounce tracking with domain-specific insights
- üé® **Modern UI**: Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for a smooth user experience
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
- üîí **Secure**: Authentication-protected dashboard for your mail server data

## Prerequisites

Before running this frontend application, you'll need:

1. A running [Postal MTA](https://github.com/postalserver/postal) server
2. Access to Postal Database

## Backend Setup

**Important**: This is only the frontend application. You must also set up the backend API to connect to your Postal database.

üëâ **Get the backend here**: [https://github.com/Praashanna/postal-stats-backend](https://github.com/Praashanna/postal-stats-backend)

The backend handles:
- Database connections to your Postal MTA instance
- API endpoints for retrieving email statistics
- Authentication and security
- Data processing and aggregation
